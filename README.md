# weather-dashboard
this is a weather dashboard that I created to show worldwide weather with the click of a button. 

this dashboard uses 2 APIs. one for weather information (openweathermap.org) and a second for random nature background images (Unsplash.com). 

this website uses a combination of JS, CSS, and HTML for its function. 

this website starts out on a loading screen with a search bar that can be used to find almost any city in the world that the OpenWeatherMap API is connected to.
