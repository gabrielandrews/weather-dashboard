# weather-dashboard
this is a weather dashboard that i created with the intention of showing worldwide weather with the click of a button. 

this dashboard uses 2 api's. one for weather information (openweathermap.org) and a second for random nature background images (Unsplash.com). 

this website uses a combination of JS, CSS, and HTML for its function. 

this website starts out on a loading screen with a searchbar that can be used to find almost any city in the world that the openweathermap api is connected too.
